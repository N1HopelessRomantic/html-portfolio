<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
One of my favourite Studio Ghibli movies!

I have watched this 3 times already.
</p>
<p>
Miyazaki did really good on this one!
</p>
<p>
My gf has watched this 6 times already... Shows you how good it is :D

<h3>Ponyo</h3>
<p>
My favourite Studio Ghibli movie! This was also my first Studio Ghibli movie.
</p>
<p>
This might be the best one because as a kid this kind of animation was so new to me!
</p>
<p>
    It will forever be my fav.
