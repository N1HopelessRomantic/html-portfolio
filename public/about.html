<h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>First Meeting</h2>
    <p>Meeting her was the best thing that could've happened to me.
      For the longest time i thought i was never gonna find true love. Until i was with her, because
      now i see a future that i wanna work towards to together with her.
    </p>
    <h2>Emergence of Love</h2>
    <p>To be honest i never thought we were gonna be an item. It just feels like it was meant to be.
      From the moment we met to the moment we found out that we had the same hobbies. For me it started out as a crush.
     Slowly but surely i was falling in love. She was so nice to me, she was interested in what i was doing
     . This was something i was longing for. I'll be honest though, I thought she was
     just being nice to me. I delusionally thought she liked me but that was it. I THOUGHT I WAS DELULU FRFR.
     Everytime i saw the workagenda and saw that she was working the same days just made me happy.
     At first i didn't clock it, but day by day that i saw her i started to realize it was not just a crush... 
     I started loving the way she smiled at me, i started adoring her laugh everytime i made a joke.
     She made my day better everytime she was there and then i ascertained that i love her.
     I also worked with someone i confided my "crush" situation to. I'm pretty sure she thought i was just a simp.
     I'll be honest i was! Everytime she did anything just made me smile like a fool thinking about her.
     IM NOT GONNA EXPOSE MYSELF FURTHER THOUGH!!!
    </p>
    <h2>Hopeful Love</h2>
    <p>After i told her i was gonna stop working at the same place soon we were both sad that we were not gonna see eachother as much anymore.
      That's when i picked up my courage to ask her if she had a way of contacting her. I was so afraid she was not gonna give me anything to be honest.
      The way i was containing my excitement when she gave me her insta was masterclass. Someone should give me an Oscar!
      That was when we started to hang out in discord, we watched anime's that we recommended to eachother.
      Everytime we watched something and called, i hopelessly fell more and more in love with her.
      At some point i just couldn't hold it in anymore my love for her was leaking.
      I'll also tell you as a self defence i told myself i was delulu and that she doesnt like me at all.
      Because after we watched Horimiya together, i was waiting for the perfect moment i would confess to her.
      The moment when i confessed though was so thrilling and because i was scared i told her that she didn't need to tell me how she felt...
      With the pressure gone from my shoulders i felt relieved but also bittersweet because she didn't react to what i said.
      I thought that was it for me but, NO! She reacted and told me that she was just speechless because it was such a cute thing i did.
      I'll tell you how it happened by the way!
      So i confessed after we watched an episode from an anime called Assassination Classroom, because the episode revolved around romance i asked her: "Hey i got a question... This episode got me thinking, how is your romantic life going?"
      She responded with "I have no romance in life because i never hung out with guys". Hearing that i was sooo excited knowing i have a small chance with her.
      So i said:"Did you know i have someone i like??". She said: "Oh you like someone? Tell me!".
      At that moment i knew i had to confess to her so i said: "Okay i'll tell you. Should i tell you her name?? YOU KNOW WHAT? I'll just tell you. I have a massive crush ILSE JASPERS!"
      She didn't react yet. So i thought i was sooo done but when she giggled and said it was just too cute that she didn't know what to say.
      After she stopped giggling she said:"You wanna know something? I also have a crush on you:) ". 
      I was stunned for a second... When i realized what she said i was internally screaming!
      Afterwards we kept talking about how we kinda knew we both had a crush on eachother.
      Days went by and now we're here. 12 months together. Thank you baby for being there when i was struggling with myself and i hope you'll be patient with me... Thank you for loving me, Thank you for making me feel wanted, You changed me in the best way possible.
    </p>
